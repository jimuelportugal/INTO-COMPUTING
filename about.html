Our Story<br><br>
Frost Shake was started by Jimuel L. Portugal, a 1st-year Computer Science student, out of his love for shakes. One day, craving a shake but unable to find a shop nearby, he decided to make his own. What began as a small idea quickly grew into something much bigger as people loved the taste and shared their positive reviews.<br><br>

Today, Frost Shake has grown into a thriving business, offering delivery services so you can enjoy your favorite shakes from the comfort of your home.<br><br>
